              The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic wonders of the
              world. Stretching over 13,000 miles, it was built over centuries to
              protect China's northern borders from invaders. Today, visitors can
              hike along sections of the wall and marvel at the breathtaking views.

              The ancient city of Petra is another wonder of the world that should
              not be missed. Carved into rock over 2,000 years ago, this stunning
              city was once the thriving capital of the Nabataean Kingdom. Visitors
              can explore the narrow canyon that leads to the city, and marvel at
              the intricate carvings and stunning architecture.
